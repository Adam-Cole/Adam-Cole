# 👋 Hi, I’m Adam
# Welcome to my portfolio!

I’m a recent computer science graduate from Mount Royal University. 

After extensive experience in exterior construction, I was fortunate to have a support system that allowed me the freedom to 
go back to school. 

I enjoy data science (statistics, ELT, and data mining) and creating fun coding projects and websites.

# Current Works in Progress

## Socialogical Impact of Tech Directed Reading

For my own curiosity and intellectual growth, I’m currently following along with a friend's directed reading to research and 
study the socialogical impact of technology in the modern age. Reading list includes: 
  - **The Chaos Machine (CURRENT, >50% done)** 
  - **Enshittification by Cory Doctorow (FINISHED)** 
  - **Artificial Unintelligence by Meredith Broussard (FINISHED)** 
  - **Coders by Clive Thompson (FINISHED)**
  - **How To Do Nothing by Jenny Odell (Not started)**
  - **Digital Exhaustion by Paul Leonardi (Not started)**

## Character Database Using Unfamiliar Tech

For my own technological growth, I'm also in the early stages of creating a database of characters I love from various media 
using technology I'm not familiar with like **Ruby on Rails, React, Tailwind, and hybrid databases (document and relational)** 
to get more familiar with these systems and technologies.
